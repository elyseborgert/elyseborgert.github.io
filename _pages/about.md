Welcome to my website! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center working as a theoretical statistican in the Genetics and Animal Breeding Unit. Previously, I completed my PhD in Statistics and Operations Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the joint supervision of Jan Hannig and J.S. Marron.
